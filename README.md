# restaurant-Page
One of TOP's projects.

HTML was created using purely JS and Webpack. 
    '.center-content' contents delete and change based on which tab you open.

What I learned in this project:
    - Webpack plugins + configuration
    - Webpack Scripts
    - Using npm on a project
    - import/export in JS
    - Proper implementation of 'Media' based on max screen-width
    - Proper use of the 'transition' property for CSS
    - Animations and the way they affect one another

Revisiting at another time and add the following:
